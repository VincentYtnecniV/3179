    <h1>WHO Health Data Visualizations</h1>
	<h2>Dataset Background</h2>
<p>The dataset used in these visualizations comes from the World Health Organization (WHO) and covers the years 2000-2016 for 183 countries. The goal is to improve health and well-being, and data is collected from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)(MMATTSON. 2023). The map compares different aspects of life expectancy across the world, and the rest of the visulisations helped explore various health-related factors and their regional impacts.</p>

        <h2>Alcohol Consumption vs. Life Expectancy</h2>
        <div class="visualization" id="c_alcohol_scatter"></div>
		<p>While scientific research has frequently highlighted the potential health benefits of moderate alcohol consumption, particularly in relation to conditions like cardiovascular diseases, it's important to note that, in the majority of instances, alcohol can have detrimental effects on health, especially when consumed at high-risk levels.(Liu, YT., Lee, J.H.. 2022)</p>

		<h2>Life Expectancy Caused by Poverty</h2>
        <h3>Yearly Average Life Expectancy</h3>

		<h3>Poverty Headcount Ratio</h3>
        <div class="visualization" id="c_pool_plot"></div>
		<p>Life expectancy exhibited an inverse relationship with poverty. Individuals residing in poverty experienced a substantially lower life expectancy, with a difference of 10.5 years in comparison to those with incomes equal to or exceeding 400% of the poverty threshold. Moreover, laborers and individuals in craft and repair occupations had notably lower life expectancies at age 18, differing by 10.9 years and 8.6 years, respectively, when contrasted with those in professional and managerial positions. Additionally, male and female renters faced a decrease in life expectancy, with a gap of 4.0 years for men and 4.6 years for women in comparison to homeowners. It is noteworthy that women belonging to the most privileged socioeconomic group surpassed men from the least advantaged group by a substantial 23.5-year margin in terms of life expectancy at age 18.(Singh, G. K., Lee, H. 2021)</p>

        <h2>Hepatitis B Immunization Coverage Over Time</h2>
		<div class="visualization" id="c_region_area"></div>
		<p>Global coverage with 3 doses of the Hepatitis B vaccine is estimated to be at 84%. This coverage indicates that a significant portion of the population worldwide has received the recommended three doses of the vaccine to develop immunity against Hepatitis B.(WHO. 2023)</p>
